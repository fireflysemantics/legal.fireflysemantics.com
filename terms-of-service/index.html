Example conditions under which service may be terminated include violations, or inconsistent actions, with respect to this Agreement, or lack of use.</p>
<h3 id="account-suspension-for-non-payment"><a class="header-anchor" href="#account-suspension-for-non-payment">§</a> Account Suspension For Non Payment</h3>
<p>You agree to and understand that Firefly Semantics Corporation has no obligation to retain data and content related to the service in the event of a suspension or termination and that such content or data may be deleted and become irretrievable if the account is more than 30 days past due. You agree that you may be required to pay a service reconnection fee in the event that service is suspended due to a delinquent account.</p>
<p>Firefly Semantics Corporation reserves the right to terminate or suspend this agreement and service if an invoice becomes delinquent (falls into arrears). Delinquent invoice balances will be subject to a one percent per month interest charge or the maximum permitted by law, if the maximum is less than one percent, plus all expenses related to collection. If the account is suspended you will continue to be charged on a monthly basis. If you or Firefly Semantics Corporation terminates the service and this agreement, you will be responsible for paying the balance due on the account computed according to the formula and terms given at the time the service was purchased or updated, given any pricing structure amendments that you have been made aware of that are at least 30 days old, and thus consistent with your pricing amendment policy.</p>
<p>If a payment is not made within ten (10) days of invoicing the account will be deemed in arrears.  Firefly Semantics may suspend service to accounts in arrears and bring legal action to collect the full amount due, including any attorneys’ costs and fees.</p>
<p>In the event that an account falls into arrears Firefly Semantics may send up to three (3) email notifications within a ten (10) day period prior to suspending the account.  If an account is suspended services operated per the account will seize to work and all application accounts, configuration, and associated data may be deleted.</p>
